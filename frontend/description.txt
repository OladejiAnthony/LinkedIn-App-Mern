#Expo Router - https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/

Expo Router uses "links" to move between pages in the app. This is conceptually similar to how the web works with <a> tags and the href attribute. <Link /> components.
By default, routes fill the entire screen. Moving between them is a full-page transition with no animation. In native apps, users expect shared elements like tab headers and tab bars to persist between pages. These are created using layout routes.

-CONFIGURATIONS-
-npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
-add this to package.json file : 
{
  "main": "expo-router/entry"
}

-add these two lines to app.json file -
{
  "scheme": "your-app-scheme"
}
"plugins": [
    "expo-router"
]

-NATIVE LAYOUTS & STACK-
One of the best advantages to React Native is being able to use native UI components. Expo Router provides a few drop-in native layouts that you can use to easily achieve familiar native behavior.
Learn how to use the Stack navigator in Expo Router.

-app/home/_layout.js
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function HomeLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack screenOptions={{ ... }} />
  );
}
